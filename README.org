* What is this?

This is the repo containing my exercises according to the book 
[[https://www.amazon.com/Exercises-Programming-Style-Cristina-Videira/dp/1482227371][Exercises in Programming Style]].

Unlike the original book, mine are written in C++ and I might transfer to other
programming languages if I see it useful.

* C++

Programs are compiled using ~CMake~. Command line ~cmake~ will be enough to
get all binaries:

#+begin_src bash
  cmake
#+end_src
